# Machine-Learning-Mini-Projects
This is a repo of mini projects I create while learning machine learning.


TODO:
1. R^2 is much lower than I would prefer for it to be: GB Conservative maxed out at ~0.65
2. Exploring RF or SVR 
3. Packaging model

# NOTE:
housing_price_prediction.ipynb is heavily vibecoded.
